# Xonix
Programmed a Xonix multiplayer (LAN) game that runs on assembly, the game runs on dosbox.

Each player has the ability to target the colored boxes which gives them super powers in order to gain a competitive edge and win the game.

The first player to die 3 times loses the game, you can kill your opponent by hitting their body with the snake's head, or you can simply corner them and let the enemy bots do the job.

If the time runs out the player with the most score will be the winner of the game.
